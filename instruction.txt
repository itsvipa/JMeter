Install JMeter 4.0 
Go to bin folder
Open jmeter.bat file to open JMeter
Add minimum parameters for testing 
- Thread Group 
- Config Element - HTTP Header Manager 
- Samplers - HTTP Request 
- Listener - View Results Tree ->Write results to file
in Filename field put path to folder where are you going to keep test results. In path create name for file (ex. C:\Users\ekulagina\Downloads\apache-jmeter-4.0\bin\test_results\result.csv)

In Thread Group -> Number of Threads (users) you should put number of users that will use API 
Ramp-Up Period (in seconds) is the amount of time Jmeter should take to get all the threads sent for the execution. Ramp-Up should be sufficient enough to avoid unnecessary and large work load from the beginning of the test execution
Loop Count - tells JMeter how many times to repeat your test
The HTTP Header Manager - lets you customize what information JMeter sends in the HTTP request header. 
Here you should put headers such as :
#Content-Type	application/json
#Accept	application/json
#Orchard-Profile-Type	LabelProfile
#Orchard-Profile-Id	****
#Orchard-User-Id	alw:****
Save 
If you use test "All tests in one" 
Open All tests in one.jmx file in JMeter
In Test Plan -> User Defined Variables change ISRC to that you need and save
