Install JMeter 4.0 
Open jmeter.bat file to open JMeter
Add minimum parameters for testing 
- Thread Group 
- Config Element - HTTP Header Manager 
- Samplers - HTTP Request 
- Listener - View Results in Table 
In Thread Group -> Number of Threads (users) you should put number of users that will use API 
Ramp-Up Period (in seconds) is the amount of time Jmeter should take to get all the threads sent for the execution. Ramp-Up should be sufficient enough to avoid unnecessary and large work load from the beginning of the test execution
Loop Count - tells JMeter how many times to repeat your test
The HTTP Header Manager lets you customize what information JMeter sends in the HTTP request header
